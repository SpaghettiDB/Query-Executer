# SQL Query Executor Documentation

## Overview
The SQL Query Executor is a component of a database engine designed to efficiently execute SQL queries. It handles the execution of parsed SQL statements, manages worker threads, interacts with the caching layer, and communicates with the storage engine. This documentation provides an overview of the design, functionality, and usage of the SQL Query Executor.

## Features
- Efficient execution of SQL queries
- Worker thread management
- Caching query results
- Interaction with the storage engine
- Scalable design for handling concurrent queries

## Architecture
The SQL Query Executor consists of several key components:
1. **Worker**: Represents a worker thread responsible for executing SQL queries. Workers have access to caches and the storage engine.
2. **Query Executor**: Manages the worker pool and assigns parsed statements to available workers for execution.
3. **Cache**: Stores cached query results to improve query performance.
4. **Storage Engine**: Manages storage and retrieval of data for query execution.

## Usage
To use the SQL Query Executor:
1. **Initialize**: Create instances of the Query Executor, Cache, and Storage Engine.
2. **Execute Query**: Parse SQL statements and pass them to the Query Executor for execution.
3. **Handle Results**: Handle query results returned by the Query Executor.

## Example
```go
// Initialize components
storage := NewStorageEngine()
caches := make(map[string]*Cache)
cacheNames := []string{"cache1", "cache2"}
for _, name := range cacheNames {
    caches[name] = NewCache(name)
}
executor := NewQueryExecutor(2, caches, storage)

// Execute parsed statement
stmt := getParsedStatement()
executor.ExecuteStatement(stmt)

```
